# require-assets

A library to package and re-use static assets.

## Installation

Install via npm:

    % npm install git+https://github.com/andreypopp/require-assets.git

## Example app

Directory `./example` in the repository contains an example application, run it
with:

    % make install example

## Concepts

The idea is to resolve references to static assets across a codebase to URLs.

The library exports a single function `requireAssets(...)`. It accepts an asset
[module id][] and returns a corresponding URL.

Internally it maintains a registry â€” a mapping from URLs to filenames. Later you
can use this registry to setup a server (or deploy on CDN) and serve required
files under expected URLs.

## Extracting asset registry from code

When referencing assets from JavaScript runtime, you'd need to import
`require-assets` under `requireAssets` identifier:

    var requireAssets = require('require-assets')

Then you can use it to get the URL of the needed static assets (an example uses
[React][] library):

    var Spinner = React.createClass({

      render: function() {
        return <img src={requireAssets('./spinner.gif')} />
      }
    })

You can access the asset registry via `requireAssets.registry`.

## Serving assets with connect/express middleware

The library includes basic connect/request middleware to serve asset registry to a
browser:

    var app           = require('express');
    var requireAssets = require('require-assets');
    var serve         = require('require-assets/middleware');

    // you created this by running browserify or xcss over the sources
    var registry = requireAssets.fromFilename('./assets.json');

    app
      .use(serve(registry))
      .listen(3000);
